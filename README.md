# 💡 HDLBits Solutions

This repository contains comprehensive **Verilog solutions** for problems from [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page) – a platform designed to help learners master hardware design concepts through hands-on coding.

Each problem from HDLBits is organized into its **own folder named exactly after the problem**, containing:

- `*.v`: The Verilog solution file (named after the problem)
- `*_tb.v`: The testbench used to verify the solution
- `README.md`: Problem description and explanation for learning/reference

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Example folder layout:
```
Wire/
├── wire.v          # Verilog solution
├── wire_tb.v       # Testbench
└── README.md       # Problem description and concepts
```

This structure repeats for all HDLBits problems — each folder is self-contained and problem-specific.
