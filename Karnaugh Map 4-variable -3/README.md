# 🧮 Kmap4 – Special K-map Logic Pattern

## 📘 Problem Statement

Implement a combinational logic circuit described by the following **4-variable Karnaugh Map**:

![K-map](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/mw/images/9/98/Kmap4.png)

You are expected to **analyze and simplify the logic function** defined by the map. Note the unique property:

> Changing any **one input** always **inverts the output**.

This indicates a highly symmetric function with a special structure.

## ✅ Inputs and Output

- **Inputs**:
  - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`: 1-bit binary inputs

- **Output**:
  - `out`: Output of the logic function based on K-map
