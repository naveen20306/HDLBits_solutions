# HDLBits - Wire

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Create a Verilog module with one input and one output that behaves like a simple wire — connecting the input to the output using a continuous assignment.

### 🎯 Objective
- Use an `assign` statement to connect `in` to `out`.
- Understand how directional wires work in Verilog.

### 🧠 Concept
- Wires are **directional** in Verilog (input ➡️ output).
- Use `assign out = in;` for a continuous connection.
