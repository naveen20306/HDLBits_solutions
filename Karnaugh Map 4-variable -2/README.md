# 🔢 Kmap3 – 4-Variable Karnaugh Map Logic

## 📘 Problem Statement

Implement the logic function described by the following **Karnaugh map (K-map)** using four input variables.

![K-map](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/mw/images/1/1f/Kmap3.png)

Simplify the function using **Sum of Products (SOP)** or **Product of Sums (POS)**. The goal is to translate the K-map’s logic into Verilog, even if your solution isn't the minimal expression.

## ✅ Inputs and Output

- **Inputs**:
  - `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` — single-bit inputs

- **Output**:
  - `out` — output determined by the logic derived from the K-map

---

## 🧩 Concepts Reinforced

- Karnaugh map simplification
- SOP/POS Boolean forms
- Efficient Verilog implementation using combinational logic
