# ðŸ“˜ exams/m2014_q4f â€“ Structural Verilog: Combinational Circuit

## ðŸ§  Problem Overview

You are asked to implement the following circuit **structurally** in Verilog using only module instantiations. The referenced schematic is available here:

This exercise reinforces the concept of **hierarchical Verilog**, where a top-level module is built by instantiating submodules and connecting them using wires â€” instead of writing the behavior directly.

## ðŸ“¥ Module Declaration

```verilog
module top_module (
    input  [3:0] in,
    output [3:0] out
);
