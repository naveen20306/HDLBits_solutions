# HDLBits - Not Gate

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Create a Verilog module that implements a **NOT gate** using an `assign` statement.

### 🎯 Objective
- Invert the input signal and drive it to the output.
- Use continuous assignment (`assign`) to implement the NOT gate behavior.

### 🧠 Concept
- This is similar to the wire problem, but instead of directly passing the input to output, we apply a bitwise NOT operation.
- Use `assign out = ~in;` to achieve this.

✅ This is a basic combinational logic problem that teaches you how to create logic gates using simple Verilog syntax.
